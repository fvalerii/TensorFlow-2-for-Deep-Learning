This folder contains the third Capstone Project of the TensorFlow 2 Specialization:

# Variational autoencoder (VAE) for a synthetic image dataset
## Normalising flow models and encoder/decoder networks with the variational autoencoder algorithm for a synthetic image dataset.
## Build normalising flow networks with random parameters to create an image dataset from the contour plots of the transformed distributions.
## Develop encoder and decoder networks with the variational autoencoder algorithm on this image dataset
